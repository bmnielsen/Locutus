# Locutus
AI for StarCraft: Brood War

## About
Locutus is a Protoss bot forked from [Steamhammer](http://satirist.org/ai/starcraft/steamhammer/). It uses [BWEB](https://github.com/Cmccrave/BWEB) for building placement, which depends on [BWEM](http://bwem.sourceforge.net/).

## Initial release
To enhance the readability of the initial open-source release, I have grouped the various features and tweaks into separate commits. The project should not be expected to compile or work at any of these intermediate commits, however. Going forward I will try to structure my work a bit better to keep the repository as clean as possible.
